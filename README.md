 Project Overview-
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming principles using a Vehicle Management System.
It showcases inheritance, abstraction, composition, aggregation, and method overriding in Java.

 Class Hierarchy-
Vehicle (abstract superclass),
Car,
Motorcycle,
Truck.
Vehicle class defines abstract methods that are implemented differently by each subclass.
Protected fields allow controlled access in subclasses.

 Instructions to Compile and Run-
javac *.java,
java Mai

 (Screenshots are uploaded)

 Reflection-
Inheritance simplified the design by allowing shared properties and behaviors in the Vehicle superclass.
Method overriding enabled each vehicle type to implement its own engine behavior.
Working with protected access required careful design to balance encapsulation and flexibility.
